# What's expected on next release of ProductionMap

**Next release expected on:** January 21 2018

### This will be a major release including:
1) Changing infrastructure from sails to express. 
2) Our new server release includes few changes which improved server stability.
3) Our client will also look very different from the latest release. More intuitive for the DevOps community.
4) Installation package for Debian
